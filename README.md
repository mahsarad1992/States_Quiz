# States_Quiz
In this quiz, the program asks the player to name a state in America. If the answer was really the name of a state, they get a point (e.g., 1/50) and also the name of that state gets written on the correct place on the map. Any time the player could input "Exit". If they miss any states, the program creates a csv file with the name of those missing states. This quiz can be used for educational purposes.
