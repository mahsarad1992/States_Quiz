# States_Quiz
In this quiz, the program asks you to name a state in America. If your answer was really the name of a state, you get a point (e.g., 1/50) and also the name of that states gets written on the correct place on the map you see. Any time you can input "Exit" and if you miss any states the program gives you a csv file with the name of those states. This quiz can be used for other educational purposes.
